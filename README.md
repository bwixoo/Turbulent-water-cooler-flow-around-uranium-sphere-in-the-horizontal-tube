# Turbulent-water-cooler-flow-around-uranium-sphere-in-the-horizontal-tube
The work investigates the thermophysical behavior of turbulent flow around a uranium sphere subjected to internal heat generation caused by nuclear fission processes. Special attention is given to temperature distribution, hydrodynamic characteristics, and the influence of Reynolds numbers and heat release intensity.
