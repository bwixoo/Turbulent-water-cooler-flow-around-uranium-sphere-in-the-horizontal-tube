# Turbulent Water Cooler Flow Around a Uranium Sphere

## Overview
This repository contains materials related to the research study  
**“Turbulent Water Cooler Flow Around a Uranium Sphere in a Horizontal Tube”**.

The work investigates the thermophysical behavior of turbulent flow around a uranium sphere subjected to internal heat generation caused by nuclear fission processes. Special attention is given to temperature distribution, hydrodynamic characteristics, and the influence of Reynolds numbers and heat release intensity.

The study is motivated by applications in nuclear engineering, plasma physics, and heat transfer in systems involving fissile materials.

## Abstract
The thermophysical problem of turbulent flow of a uranium sphere cooled by a water flow is studied for various values of heat release and Reynolds numbers. The analysis focuses on boundary regions and temperature fields formed due to internal fission heating processes.

A self-consistent approach combining kinetic Boltzmann equations and gas-dynamic equations is employed. Numerical simulations are performed to analyze heat transfer and flow behavior under different pressure and neutron flux conditions.
